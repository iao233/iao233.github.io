        <p>About Me</p>
        <p1>
            My name is Isfar Oshir. I came to the United States when I was just two years old. I've been very much interested with
            computers from a very early age, and I wanted to know how these machines worked from behind the scenes.

        <p>Hobbies</p>
        <p2>
            My favorite sport is soccer. I love playing the sport on the weekends as a leisurely venture. 
            I also like to play video games because they allow me to step into worlds, stories, and shoes that
            would otherwise be impossible in reality. 
            I also like to watch movies and TV.
            I also manage to find time to learn more programming and pick up skills along the way.
            In addition, I also like to teach other people about anything that I am well-knowledged in. Providing others 
            with knowledge gives me a great deal of pleasure because it lets me know I have aided someone in their own path.
        </p2>

        <p>Education</p>
        <p3>
            I have gone to Brooklyn Technical High School, which is a very well-renowned high school
            in New York City. 
        </p3>
        <p4>
            I am currently attending New York University as a computer science major.
